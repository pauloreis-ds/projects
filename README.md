[(PT-BR) Campanha de Marketing Direcionado no Ifood.](https://sites.google.com/view/pauloreis/o-projetos/ifood-marketing-campaign) 

The marketing department was pressured to spend its annual budget more wisely [...] It is your challenge to <br>
understand the data, find business opportunities & insights, and to propose data-driven action to optimize <br>
the campaign’s results & generate value to the company.

    You need to provide the marketing team a better understanding of the characteristic 
    features of respondents. How do variables connect with response rates? 
    What other relationships between variables are interesting for the business? 
    Which actionable can we take out of the EDA?
    
    Propose and describe a customer segmentation based on customers’ behaviors.
    How many and which profiles are there in the database? 
    How does segmentation connect to the campaign's financial return?
    
    Create a predictive model which allows the company to maximize the profit of the next
    marketing campaign. What is the best metric that correlates with the profitability of
    the campaign?

    What is TopBank's current Churn rate? How does it vary monthly?
    
    What is the expected return, in terms of revenue, if the company
    uses your model to avoid churn from customers?
