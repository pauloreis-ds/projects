### [Reducing the rate of customer turnover (CHURN).](https://github.com/pauloreis-ds/Projetos/tree/master/classification-churn)
[Reduzindo a taxa de rotatividade de clientes.](https://sites.google.com/view/pauloreis/o-projetos/topbank-churn)

TopBank is a large banking services company. It operates mainly in European countries offering financial products, <br>
from bank accounts to investments. Concerned about the churn rate [...] TopBank's Analytics team hired you as a Data <br> 
Science consultant to create an action plan [...] preventing the customer from canceling his contract and not renew it.

    What is TopBank's current Churn rate? How does it vary monthly?
    
    What is the expected return, in terms of revenue, if the company
    uses your model to avoid churn from customers?

And as a Data Scientist hired by the company, you have to help finding the best opportunities in the real estate market...

    Which houses should the House Rocket CEO buy and at what purchase price?

    Should House Rocket do a renovation to increase the sale price?

    What would be the suggestions for changes? What is the increase in the
